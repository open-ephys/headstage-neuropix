# headstage-neuropix
Serialized, multifunction headstage targeting the neuropixels 1.0 probe. This
headstages supports serialized acqusition from:

- Two neuropixels 1.0 probes.
- A BNO055 9-axis IMU for real-time, 3D orientation tracking.
- Two TS4231 light to digital converters for real-time, 3D position tracking
  with HTC Vive base stations
- A high performance MAX10 FPGA for real-time processing
